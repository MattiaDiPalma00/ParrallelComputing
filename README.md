# ParrallelComputing

The purpose of the software is the calculation of the sum of N numbers executed on architecture parallel MIMD-DM, we will also evaluate the efficiency of the implemented algorithm and the
We will compare with the routine MPI_reduce.As specified by the track the algorithm uses the second strategy, which provides that, at the end of the computation, the final result is present in a only preset processor, in our case it will be (P0).
